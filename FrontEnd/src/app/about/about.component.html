      <h1 class="display-4">WHAT IS AUTISM ?</h1>
      <p class="lead">There is no one type of autism, but many.
        Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges
        with
        social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers for Disease
        Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States today.</p>
      <p class="lead">
        We know that there is not one autism but many subtypes, most influenced by a combination of genetic and
        environmental factors. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set of
        strengths and challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think and problem-solve can range from
        highly skilled to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require significant support in their daily
        lives,
        while others may need less support and, in some cases, live entirely independently.</p>
      <p class="lead">Indicators of autism usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear
        even earlier, and often, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Research shows that early intervention leads
        to positive outcomes later in life for people with autism,SO from this point we decide to built our expert
        website
        which operate using data mining algorithms In addition to the medical evaluation CARS Which predicts whether the
        patient has autism or not based on a set of questions that show a set of characteristics taken from the DSM5.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">for each question there is some choices each of them has an score ,at the end all the scores will
        be
        summed and based on the total we will see if the patient has an ASD or not.</p>
